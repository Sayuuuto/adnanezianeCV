 A dramatic and intense portrait photograph of Achraf Hakimi with a visible word 'SRAM' written on his forehead. Hakimi's expression should be angry and intense, with his eyes looking directly at the camera. The lighting should be low-key, casting dramatic shadows across his face and emphasizing his facial features. The background should be dark, with no distractions from Hakimi's powerful presence.
