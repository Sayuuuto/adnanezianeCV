A digital painting of Vladimir Putin wearing a traditional Moroccan Djellaba, standing in a bustling Moroccan marketplace. The painting should capture the intricate details of the Djellaba, including the colors, patterns, and textures. Putin should be depicted in a dignified yet approachable pose, with a warm smile on his face as he interacts with the locals. The background should include a variety of Moroccan cultural elements, such as spices, textiles, and pottery. The overall feel of the painting should be vibrant and lively, capturing the spirit of Moroccan culture. 8K --ar 2:3 --s 550 --v 5
