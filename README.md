A candid photograph of French President Emmanuel Macron pouring Moroccan mint tea in a traditional teapot, while seated on a cushion inside a beautifully decorated mosque. The design of the mosque should feature intricate details such as arabesque patterns, colorful mosaics, and ornate pillars. The setting should be well lit, with natural light streaming in through the windows and casting soft shadows on the floor. The composition should convey a sense of cultural exchange and appreciation, with Macron's respectful demeanor and the tea ceremony highlighting the hospitality and warmth of Moroccan tradition. The image should be shot from a low angle to showcase the grandeur of the mosque's interior, and should be high resolution with a 2:3 aspect ratio --v 5
