A digital art piece featuring a close-up photograph of a furious Emmanuel Macron with the word 'SRAM' written on his forehead in bold letters. The artwork should have a dark and dramatic tone, with heavy shadows and contrasting lighting that highlights the emotion on Macron's face. The composition should be tightly focused on his face, capturing every detail of his expression. The background should be simple and unobtrusive, with a solid color or a subtle texture that complements the overall mood of the artwork 8K --ar 2:3 --s 550 --v 5
